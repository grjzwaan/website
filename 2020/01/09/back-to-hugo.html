<p>Last year I experimented with <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/">Sapper</a> Sapper to create a static blog, but I’ve already switched back to <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>. Mainly because I’ve <em>done</em> the experiment and learned from it.</p>

<p>Writing a post had little speedbumps and the result was no posts since october. At least I know where the line is for me.</p>
