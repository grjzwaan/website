Last year I experimented with [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/) Sapper to create a static blog, but I've already switched back to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Mainly because I've _done_ the experiment and learned from it. 

Writing a post had little speedbumps and the result was no posts since october. At least I know where the line is for me.
